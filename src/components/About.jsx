        Hello! My name is Nrusinghamath Sahu, and I come from Koraput, Odisha. 
        I have recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Education from Acharya 
        Nagarjuna University in 2022. Prior to that, I graduated with Botany Honours 
        from Utkal University in 2020. I received my Higher Secondary education from 
        Sai College of Science, Jeypore, Odisha, and my schooling was completed at SAIEC, 
        Rayagada.

        <p className="text-xl">
        During the pandemic lockdown, I developed a keen interest in technology and coding, 
        which led me to start learning to code. I am passionate about this field and have 
        taken the next step towards pursuing a career in it by joining the backend bootcamp 
        organization, FunctionUp, in September 2022. At FunctionUp, I have gained in-depth 
        knowledge of various technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, MongoDB, 
        React, Express, AWS-S3, Redis, Git, GitHub, and many more.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl">
        I am thrilled to have acquired these skills and am excited to take on new challenges 
        in the tech industry. I am a quick learner, hardworking, and highly motivated individual 
        who is always eager to learn and grow. With my educational background and technical skills, 
        I am confident that I can make a meaningful contribution to the industry. I am constantly 
        striving to improve and enhance my skills and knowledge, and I am looking forward to new 
        opportunities to further develop my career in the technologyÂ sector.
